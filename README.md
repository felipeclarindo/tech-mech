# Tech Mech

This is a website project of a fictitious automotive workshop seeking to improve the customer experience with your vehicle, improving the time spent and bringing a reduction in lost time. The site is an extension of Porto and was created using **Java** for the development of the api and for the Front-end we use **Next.js\*** and **TypeScript** in order to present the workshop, a little about us, and most importantly: a **Virtual Assistant** capable of performing pre-diagnostics, pre-budges and schedules.

## Functionalities

- Login Pages and User Registration
- Home page that presents the services of the workshop.
- "About Us" page that details the team and the history of the workshop.
- Virtual Assistant to assist with diagnostics and scheduling.
- Additional pages such as an attendee area and a custom error page.
